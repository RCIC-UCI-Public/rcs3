These are NOTES that will go into the web docs
I.  Brand new AWS account - setting up the admin side

    a. Edit the file config/aws-settings.yaml to reflect site naming
       1. replace everything with uci-p (uci "production") with something else (e.g., <universityname>-p)
       2. Change the admin_notify and owner_notify to something that makes local sense.       

    b. Create the default Storage Lens Configuration
       cloudadmin/create-storage-lens.sh

    c. Create the administrator notification topic and subscribe your admins to it
       cloudadmin/create-admin-sns-topic.py -e <email1> [<email> ...]

II. New System to be added

    A. Cloudadmin tasks
        a. create the backup bucket for the owner-system
            cloudadmin/create-bucket-with-inventory.sh <owner> <system>

        b. Transmit securely (in zoom chat seems to work, the access key, password for the system's service account)

        c. create the owner notification topic for the bucket
           cloudadmin/create-sns-topic.py <owner> <system> -x [-e email [email email ...]] 

        d. create the bucket alarms with object and storage limits
           cloudadmin/set-bucket-alarms.py <owner> <system> <#objects quota> <#TB space quota>


    B. Sysadmin tasks
        a.  Have the system administrator clone the github repo.  
        b.  Make sure key software is installed: (Python3 with yaml module, aws, rclone)
        c.  After the bucket has been created, localize the setup
            sysadmin/localize.py <owner> <system>
            --> this requires the access key/password from above. Asked for interactively
        d.  Copy templates/jobs.yaml config/jobs.yaml
            edit to reflect the specific configuration of the system
        e.  Dryrun test the backup
            sysadmin/gen-backup.py --dryrun run
