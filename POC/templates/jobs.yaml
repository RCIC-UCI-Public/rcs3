## This is a sample jobs.yaml the defines a single backup job
## relative to the root "/" path
## Path is common to the jobs relative to the path

  ## Patterns from a file to exclude
  exclude_file: common_excludes.yaml

## Job names must be distinct (not checked, yet)
## job "backup1" 
##   copies everything in /volume1 (the '/' comes from path: above)
##   excludes any subdirectory starting with 'backup-config' (At any depth in /volume1)  
  jobs:
    - name: backup1 
      subdirectories:
        - volume1 
      excludes:
        - backup-config/**
